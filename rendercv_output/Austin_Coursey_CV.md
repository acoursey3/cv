# Summary

3rd year computer science Ph.D. student at Vanderbilt University. Interested in developing and applying machine learning solutions to solve problems in real-world complex systems. Research interests include reinforcement learning, prognostics, anomaly detection, and continual learning. Recently completed a NASA System-Wide Safety project where I developed and deployd a controller that improved unmanned aerial vehicle control under strong wind disturbances. Currently researching the intersection of safe and continual reinforcement learning as part of my NSF Graduate Research Fellowship.
